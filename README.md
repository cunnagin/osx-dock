# osx-dock
OS X like dock implemented in CSS only. This example is written as a Meteor project.

## What it is...
This is a demo of an OSX dock using CSS only to do reflections & animations using the transform parameter.

I'm running the demo as a Meteor application, so button clicks, etc... are handled by the .js file. When you click on a dock element, it lets you know whch one it was. The id id set in the HTML code.

Dock elements are added in HTML.
